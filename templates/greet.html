        <h1>Welcome to MySQL Case Study</h1>
        <p>{{ greeting }}</p>
        <p>Thank you for participating in our MySQL case study!</p>
        <p>In this case study, we aim to explore various aspects of MySQL database management and its application in
            real-world scenarios.</p>
        <p>Throughout the case study, you will have the opportunity to learn about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Database design and schema creation</li>
            <li>SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval</li>
            <li>Database administration and optimization techniques</li>
            <li>Integration of MySQL with web applications using frameworks like Flask</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope you find this case study informative and engaging. Feel free to explore and interact with the MySQL
            database as you proceed through the study.</p>
        <p>Once again, welcome aboard, and let's dive into the world of MySQL!</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our MySQL Case Study!</p>
            <p>In this MySQL case study, we embark on an exciting journey into the world of art and data analysis.
                Leveraging the power of MySQL, we delve deep into a rich dataset encompassing paintings, artists,
                museums, and more, sourced from the renowned <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings">Famous Paintings dataset</a>.</p>
            <p>We harness the capabilities of various technologies, including PostgreSQL, PgAdmin4, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy,
                to conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset. Our exploration covers a wide range of topics, from data
                loading and manipulation to insightful SQL queries and analysis.</p>
            <p>The SQL queries we craft provide valuable insights into the art world, enabling data-driven decision-making
                processes and fostering a deeper understanding of the dataset. From identifying popular painting styles
                to analyzing museum opening hours, each query uncovers unique aspects of the art dataset.</p>
            <p>This case study not only showcases the power of MySQL for data analysis but also highlights the intersection
                of art and technology. Through our exploration, we aim to inspire further research and discovery in the
                realm of art and data analytics.</p>

            <h2>Database Schema</h2>
            <!-- <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='Dataset Image.png') }}" alt="Image description"> -->
            <p>The MySQL database schema used in this case study is designed to effectively organize and store the art-related data. It consists of multiple tables, each representing different entities such as paintings, artists, museums, and more.</p>
            <p>Here's an overview of the main tables and their relationships:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>work:</strong> Contains information about individual paintings, including their titles, artists, and associated museums.</li>
                <li><strong>artist:</strong> Stores details about artists, such as their names, nationalities, and styles.</li>
                <li><strong>museum:</strong> Represents museums and includes data such as museum names, locations, and operating hours.</li>
                <li><strong>subject:</strong> Records the subjects or themes depicted in paintings.</li>
                <li><strong>canvas_size:</strong> Describes the sizes of canvases used for paintings.</li>
                <li><strong>product_size:</strong> Contains information about product sizes related to paintings, such as sale prices and regular prices.</li>
                <li><strong>image_link:</strong> Stores links to images of paintings.</li>
                <li><strong>museum_hours:</strong> Defines the opening and closing hours of museums on different days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The relationships between these tables are established through primary and foreign key constraints, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient querying.</p>
            <p>Overall, the database schema provides a comprehensive structure for storing and managing art-related data, facilitating various analyses and insights.</p>
